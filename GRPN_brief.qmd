## Groupon, Inc. (GRPN) - SELL / SHORT

**Fundamental Rationale (Bearish):**
Groupon (GRPN) operates a local e-commerce marketplace and is currently undergoing a significant transformation strategy. However, the company faces severe long-term fundamental challenges, including a chronic decline in global revenue (5-year CAGR of -24.7%) and a history of unprofitability, despite a small, recent GAAP profit in Q1 2025. Financial health is precarious, with high leverage (Debt/Equity ratio of 5.5), negative Q1 2025 free cash flow (-$3.8M), and consistently poor returns on capital (5-year average ROE of -1,148.6%). Valuation metrics are concerning, with an extremely high P/B ratio of 23.4 and a forward P/E of 334.4, suggesting the market expects a very significant turnaround that is far from certain given intense competition.

**Technical Rationale (Bearish):**
The recent sharp rally in GRPN's stock (+53% in a single month) has pushed it into significant resistance around the $27-$30 level on climactic volume. This price action, coupled with overbought readings on both weekly and monthly RSI and Stochastic RSI indicators, strongly suggests a potential exhaustion move or a blow-off top. A failure to hold above the recent breakout level of $19.73 would confirm a bull trap and open significant downside. The technical picture aligns with the bearish fundamental outlook, offering a potentially attractive entry for short positions.

**Outlook & Concerns:**
While management highlights "green shoots" like North American local billings growth, the overall business model remains under pressure from intense competition and secular headwinds. The company's turnaround is a multi-year effort with high execution risk. Over 51% ownership concentration by Pale Fire Capital also presents unique governance considerations. Given the dire fundamentals, stretched valuation, and technical signs of a climactic top, a SELL/SHORT recommendation is maintained. Analyst consensus price target is $22.75, implying downside.
